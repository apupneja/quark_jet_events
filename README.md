# Genie GSoC 2023 Tasks

**Dataset:** Data of Quark/Gluon jet events available here. The dataset consists of 3 channels (ECAL, HCAL and Tracks) each containing 125x125 images.

**Task 1: Auto-encoder of the quark/gluon events** </br>
**Task 2: Jets as graphs** </br>
**Task 3: Diffusion model to represent the events** </br>

README file for the individual task is included in the directory.

**Note:** None of these models have been trained completely, because of timeout of google colab sessions, and other compute costraints
